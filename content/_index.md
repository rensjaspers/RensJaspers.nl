Since 2014 I have been collaborating on healthcare information systems as a frontend developer. My main interests are creating intuitive user interfaces and writing clean code. 

I studied East Asian Studies (MA) and Japan Studies (BA) at Leiden University, focusing on linguistics and online communication. I have also worked as a professional web designer since 2008. 

I enjoy combining my web development skills with my linguistics expertise when developing software.
